# EmailSender

To run this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the EmailLibrary Solution. Then, run the project by clicking the green play button at the top of Visual Studio. The login screen will allow
you to enter your email and password, and if successfully authenticated, will take you to a screen showing the emails sent on your account by the application. At the bottom of the window there is a button which opens
another window for sending emails. On clicking this button, the window will open and allow you to type in the Recipient, Subject, and Body of an email, and you can send the email using the send button. The details of the email are logged in the EmailDatabase.mdf file and displayed in the original window. Before running the project, make sure that the connection to the EmailDatabaseFile is working by refreshing the connection in the "Server Explorer" view.
